// examples/scenarios/02-reboot-offline-check.js — simulates an app restart: a
// NEW process loading purely from disk and calling getEntitlement() with no
// network involved, proving the offline path actually works (not just the
// happy-path-in-one-process case). Requires 01-first-activation.js to have
// run first — that's the "before the reboot" half of this story.
//
// The "new process" claim is real, not simulated: this script is invoked as
// its own separate `node` command (by a human, or by run-all.js spawning it
// as a child process) — never imported and called in-process alongside 01.
