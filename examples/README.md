# keyforge-client examples

A runnable verification suite that exercises `keyforge-client` against a real,
running Keyforge server — not mocks. Two purposes: confidence-building (does
this actually work end to end?) and living integration documentation for
whoever wires this module into the real menu platform later.

This is additive tooling, not one of `ARCHITECTURE.md` §13's four
implementation phases — see `PROGRESS.md`'s Phase 4 addendum.

## How it's structured

Six scenarios simulate **one branch installation's lifecycle**, run in order
against a single shared on-disk state file (`examples/.state/state.json`):

| # | Scenario | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| 01 | `first-activation` | `activate()` + `getEntitlement()` on a fresh install |
| 02 | `reboot-offline-check` | A brand-new process, loading purely from disk, still reports `valid` — no network involved |
| 03 | `background-refresh` | `refresh()` against the live server actually advances the on-disk watermarks |
| 04 | `revoked-license` | Revoking via the admin API, then `refresh()`, makes `getEntitlement()` report `revoked` |
| 05 | `deactivate-and-reactivate` | `deactivate()` clears state but keeps `installationFingerprint`; re-`activate()` reuses it |
| 06 | `tampered-state-rejection` | Directly corrupting `state.json` on disk makes `getEntitlement()` report `tampered`, not crash |

They run in this order **on purpose** — each one builds on the state the
previous one left on disk (06 is deliberately last, since it leaves the
entitlement token unusable). Each script is still independently runnable as
its own `node` command; if you run one before its prerequisite, it exits with
a clear "run `0N-...js` first" message rather than a confusing crash.

## Prerequisites

1. **A running Keyforge server + MongoDB.** In your Keyforge server checkout:
   ```
   docker compose up -d mongo   # or point MONGODB_URI at any local mongod
   npm run dev                  # or `npm run dev:all` to also run the admin dashboard
   ```
2. **A generated signing keypair**, in that same checkout, if one doesn't
   already exist:
   ```
   npm run generate-signing-keypair -- --version 1
   ```
   This writes `keys/private-v1.pem` (used by the server) and
   `keys/public-v1.pem` (what this suite needs — see below).
3. **Admin credentials.** No special bootstrap step is required — just pick
   an email/password for `examples/.env` below. `setup-fixtures.js` will
   register that admin automatically if the server's database has none yet,
   or log in with it if one already exists.

## Configuration

```
cp examples/.env.example examples/.env
```

Then edit `examples/.env`:

| Var | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `KEYFORGE_BASE_URL` | Server origin, default `http://localhost:3000`. |
| `KEYFORGE_ADMIN_EMAIL` / `KEYFORGE_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Bootstraps the first admin, or logs into an existing one. |
| `KEYFORGE_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` | Path to your Keyforge server checkout's `keys/public-v1.pem`. Not committed to this repo, not a shared value — point it at wherever you cloned the server. |
| `KEYFORGE_KEY_VERSION` | Default `1`. Must match the server's `LICENSE_SIGNING_KEY_VERSION`. |

## Running it

**Everything, one command:**

```
npm run examples:run-all
```

Runs `setup-fixtures.js`, all six scenarios in order, then
`teardown-fixtures.js`, and prints a pass/fail summary. Safe to re-run
immediately afterward — setup sweeps any stale fixtures before creating new
ones.

**Step by step**, to read each scenario's output as you go:

```
npm run examples:setup
node examples/scenarios/01-first-activation.js
node examples/scenarios/02-reboot-offline-check.js
node examples/scenarios/03-background-refresh.js
node examples/scenarios/04-revoked-license.js
node examples/scenarios/05-deactivate-and-reactivate.js
node examples/scenarios/06-tampered-state-rejection.js
npm run examples:teardown
```

## What `setup-fixtures.js` does

Creates a `Product` → `Plan` → `Customer` → `Subscription` → `License` chain
via the admin API (all named/slugged with a `KFC Example` prefix plus a
per-run timestamp — see the residue note below for why — so they're
identifiable and safe to run against a real dev database — nothing else gets
touched). Captures the License's one-time-disclosed `licenseKey`, validates
`KEYFORGE_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH` is a real public key PEM, and writes both to
`examples/.state/fixtures.json` for the scenarios to read. Before creating
anything, it sweeps away any `KFC Example`-prefixed fixtures already present
that the admin API will still allow deleting (see below), so the whole suite
is re-runnable from scratch without manual dashboard clicking. Expected
output ends with:

```
Fixtures ready:
  Product:      <id> (kfc-example-1786751136004)
  Plan:         <id>
  Customer:     <id>
  Subscription: <id>
  License:      <id>
  License key:  KF-XXXX-XXXX-...
  Public key:   /path/to/keys/public-v1.pem (version 1)
```

## What `teardown-fixtures.js` does

The same name-prefix sweep, run as actual cleanup: deactivates the recorded
installation (if any), then attempts to delete License → Subscription →
Customer/Plan → Product in the order the admin API's dependents-guard
requires, and removes `examples/.state/`. Safe to run even if a prior run
crashed partway — it discovers fixtures by name, not by trusting a
particular run's IDs.

### A confirmed, permanent limitation: activated fixtures can't be deleted

Verified end to end against a real server, not assumed: **once a License has
been activated even once, neither it nor anything upstream of it (its
Subscription, Plan, Customer, Product) can ever be deleted through the admin
API.** `deactivate()` only marks the server's Activation record
`'deactivated'` — it's never removed — and the delete-guard's dependents
check counts Activation rows regardless of status. There is no admin route
to delete an Activation directly. Since every scenario run activates the
fixture license (that's the whole point), **every full run of this suite
leaves its `Product`/`Plan`/`Customer`/`Subscription`/`License` chain
permanently in your Keyforge dev database** — `teardown-fixtures.js`
reports this plainly (`Not deleted (HAS_DEPENDENTS): ...` per row, then a
summary note) rather than treating it as a failure.

This is the same category of thing as Keyforge server's own `ApiKey`
(revoke-only, no delete) and `AuditLog` (no delete at all) rows — expected,
permanent, and already accepted in that repo's own `VERIFICATION.md`. It's
why `setup-fixtures.js` suffixes every fixture's name/slug with a timestamp
(`kfc-example-<runId>`) instead of reusing a fixed one: a fixed slug would
collide with the previous run's now-undeletable `Product`, breaking
re-runnability entirely. All residue still shares the `KFC Example` prefix,
so it stays easy to identify (and query) later if you ever want to survey
how much of it has accumulated.

## Expected output, scenario by scenario

Each scenario prints `PASS <check>` / `FAIL <check>` lines (and exits nonzero
on any failure), plus the raw `activate()`/`getEntitlement()`/etc. results it
observed. For example, `01-first-activation.js`:

```
activate() -> {"expiresAt":1234567890}
PASS activate() resolves with a numeric expiresAt
getEntitlement() -> {"status":"valid","expiresAt":1234567890,"features":{...}}
PASS getEntitlement() reports 'valid' on a fresh activation (got 'valid')

All checks passed.
```

`03-background-refresh.js` additionally prints a before/after snapshot of the
raw stored watermarks, so you can see `highestIssuedAtSeen` and
`lastValidatedAt` advance and `entitlementToken` change in place.

`05-deactivate-and-reactivate.js` logs the `installationFingerprint` value
before and after, confirming it's identical across `deactivate()` →
`activate()` — and logs the un-revoke admin-API call it makes first (see note
below).

## A note on scenario 05's un-revoke step

Scenario 04 leaves the fixture license revoked. The server's own error table
blocks `activate()` on a revoked license (`LICENSE_REVOKED`, 403) the same as
it blocks `refresh()`/`validate()` — so scenario 05 restores the license to
`active` via the admin API before calling `activate()` again. This is also a
realistic real-world sequence (an admin lifts a revocation, the branch
reactivates), not just a workaround.

## Revocation propagation

Per `README.md` (this repo's own, not this file) and Keyforge server's own
architecture: `getEntitlement()` runs entirely offline and cannot know about
a revocation that happened after the last successful `refresh()`. Scenario 04
demonstrates the *detection* path (revoke → `refresh()` → `getEntitlement()`
reports `revoked`) — it does not, and can't, demonstrate instant/offline
revocation, since that's not how this system is designed to work.

## Troubleshooting

- **`REGISTRATION_CLOSED` error from `setup-fixtures.js`**: an admin account
  already exists on the target server and doesn't match
  `KEYFORGE_ADMIN_EMAIL`/`KEYFORGE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`. Either fix `examples/.env`
  to match it, or in your Keyforge server checkout run
  `npm run create-admin -- <email>` (password via stdin) to create a fresh
  one, or `npm run delete-admin -- <existing-email>` to remove a stale one.
- **`UNREACHABLE` / connection errors**: the Keyforge server isn't running at
  `KEYFORGE_BASE_URL`, or MongoDB isn't up. See Prerequisites above.
- **`docker compose up -d mongo` fails with a port-already-in-use error**: you
  (or another project) already have a `mongod` listening on `27017` — that's
  fine, this suite doesn't care which Mongo it is. Just point the Keyforge
  server checkout's `MONGODB_URI` at it and skip the `docker compose` step.
- **`Not deleted (HAS_DEPENDENTS)` lines from `teardown-fixtures.js`**: this
  is expected once fixtures have been activated, not an error — see "A
  confirmed, permanent limitation" above.
- **Errors reading `KEYFORGE_PUBLIC_KEY_PATH`**: confirm the path exists and
  points at a `public-v<N>.pem` file from your Keyforge server checkout's
  `keys/` directory (run `npm run generate-signing-keypair -- --version 1`
  there if it's missing), and that `KEYFORGE_KEY_VERSION` matches its `<N>`
  and the server's own `LICENSE_SIGNING_KEY_VERSION`.
- **"run `0N-...js` first" errors**: you ran a scenario out of order, or
  against a `.state/` left over from a different run. Start over with
  `npm run examples:setup` and run scenarios 01→06 in order (or just use
  `npm run examples:run-all`).
